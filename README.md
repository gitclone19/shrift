Encryption Decryptor Tool
This program is designed to detect the type of encryption (Base64, Hex, AES, or Caesar Cipher) and decrypt the given input automatically. If a specific encry>

How It Works
Encryption Detection:

The program tries to determine whether the input is Base64, Hex, AES, or Caesar Cipher.
Detection is performed in the following order:
Base64
Hexadecimal
AES (requires a key from the user)
Caesar Cipher (tested with shifts from 1 to 25)
Decryption:

For Base64 and Hex, the program directly decodes the data.
For AES, the user must provide the encryption key, which is hashed using SHA-256 to generate the appropriate AES key.
For Caesar Cipher, the program attempts all possible shifts (1â€“25) to find a readable output.
Output:

If a matching encryption type is found, the decrypted output is displayed.
If the program cannot detect or decrypt the input, it informs the user.
Libraries Used
The program relies on the following Python libraries:

base64: For encoding and decoding Base64 strings.
hashlib: To hash the AES key using SHA-256.
Crypto (from pycryptodome): For AES decryption and padding utilities.
Prerequisites
Before running the program, ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher). Additionally, you need to install the required libraries.

Installation
Clone the repository or copy the script to your local machine.
Install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install pycryptodome

The program is now ready to run.
Usage
Run the program using Python:

python reader.py

Enter the encrypted text when prompted.
If the input uses AES encryption, the program will ask for the key. Otherwise, it will attempt to decrypt automatically.
The program will display the decrypted output or inform you if the encryption type couldn't be identified.
Example Usage
Base64 Decryption
Input:
U2Fsb20gRHVueW9nYQ==

Output:
Salom Dunyoga

Hexadecimal Decryption
Input:
53616c6f6d2044756e796f6761

Output:
Salom Dunyoga

AES Decryption
Input:
Base64-encoded AES-encrypted data
Key:
mysecretkey

Output:
Decrypted plaintext

Caesar Cipher Decryption
Input:
Uifsf jt b tfdsfu!

Output:
There is a secret! (Shift: 1)

Limitations
The program only supports Base64, Hex, AES (CBC mode), and Caesar Cipher. Other encryption methods like RSA or Blowfish are not supported.
AES decryption requires the correct key to work.
Detection is sequential, meaning the program checks Base64 first, followed by Hex, AES, and finally Caesar Cipher.
